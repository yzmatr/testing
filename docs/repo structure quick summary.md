üîÑ 8-Step Pipeline Process  
Step 1: Setup & Configuration  
Defines 15 target frog species for classification  
Sets up directories and constants  
Configures audio parameters (16kHz sampling, 30s windows)  
Uses 500 samples per class maximum

)  
Tracks all parameters, metrics, and artifacts  
Supports both local SQLite and server-based tracking  
Automatically logs model artifacts and training curves  
Step 3: Data Selection & Balancing  
Apply to presentation...  
DataFrame  
Loads raw FrogID CSV data (20250317.csv)  
Applies quality filters (removes duplicates, poor quality, inappropriate content)  
Creates balanced dataset with downsampling strategy  
Generates class labels (0-14 for target species, 15 for "Other")  
Step 4: Audio Download

files  
Downloads audio files from URLs in parallel (5 workers)  
Converts AAC to WAV format using pydub/ffmpeg  
Implements retry logic and error handling  
Skips already downloaded files  
Step 5: Audio Preprocessing Pipeline

parameters  
This makes the pipeline highly configurable and reproducible \- you can easily modify parameters without changing code.  
üìä Experiment Tracking  
The pipeline integrates deeply with MLflow to track:  
All hyperparameters and configurations  
Training metrics and validation curves  
Model artifacts and checkpoints  
Data distributions and preprocessing stats  
Evaluation metrics and confusion matrices  
Generated plots and visualizations  
This creates a complete audit trail for each experiment, enabling easy comparison and reproducibility.  
The pipeline is designed for production ML workflows with proper error handling, logging, caching, and experiment management \- making it suitable for both research and deployment scenarios.
